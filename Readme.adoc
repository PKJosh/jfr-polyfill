= JFR Polyfill

This `jfr-polyfill` library is for those projects that still have to support old JDKs that don't have Java Flight Recorder (JFR) support,
but still want to be able to leverage JFR when it is available.

== Usage Instructions

Just add `jfr-polyfill` as a dependency, it will serve as fallback implementation when JFR is not available.
If JFR is available it is on the boot classpath and will take priority over theK polyfill.
